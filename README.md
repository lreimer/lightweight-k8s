# Lightweight K8s

When it comes to running Kubernetes in resource constraint environments like your local developer workstation or edge and IoT devices a full-blown Kubernetes distribution is definitely not the right choice. Instead a new breed of super lightweight, certified Kubernetes distributions that (often) come as a single-binary are suited a lot better. This repository will showcase two popular choices: MicroK8s and K3s on public cloud and NUC powered Cloudkoffer.
